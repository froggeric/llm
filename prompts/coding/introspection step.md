Critically review the proposed plan against these criteria:

1.  **Correctness:** Identify logical flaws, algorithmic errors, and potential bugs.
2.  **Regressions:** Will this change break existing functionality? Explicitly state potential side-effects and how to mitigate them.
3.  **Best Practices:** Is the plan idiomatic, maintainable, and aligned with modern development standards? Consider design patterns, code structure, and security.
4.  **Completeness:** Are there missing steps, dependencies, configuration changes, or required tests? Ensure all details are present.
5.  **Integration:** How does this plan fit into the existing codebase? Check for conflicts, inconsistencies, or better integration points.

Update the plan to fix all identified issues. The final output should be the complete, implementation-ready plan.
